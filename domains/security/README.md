# 🛡️ Security Domain

**Credentials, environment variables, access control, security event processing**

This domain manages all security-related functionality including event processing, credential management, and access control policies.

## 📁 Components

### Core Security Modules
- **`security-event-processor.js`** - Real-time security event analysis and processing

### Security Responsibilities
- **Event Classification**: Automated security event categorization
- **Threat Detection**: Real-time threat pattern recognition
- **Credential Management**: Secure handling of authentication data
- **Access Control**: Policy enforcement and validation

## 🎯 Security Principles

### Zero Trust Architecture
All security events are processed with zero trust assumptions, requiring validation at every step.

### Real-time Processing
Security events are processed immediately upon receipt to enable rapid response to threats.

### Comprehensive Logging
All security-related activities are logged for audit and compliance purposes.

## 🔍 Event Processing Pipeline

1. **Event Ingestion**: Receive events from FortiGate devices
2. **Normalization**: Standardize event formats
3. **Classification**: Categorize by threat level and type
4. **Correlation**: Link related events across time and devices
5. **Response**: Trigger appropriate security responses

## 📊 Security Metrics

- **Event Processing Rate**: Real-time processing capability
- **Threat Detection Accuracy**: Automated classification precision
- **Response Time**: Time from event to action
- **False Positive Rate**: Accuracy of threat detection
