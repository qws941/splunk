# 🛠️ Defense Domain

**Proactive defense systems, error prevention, system resilience**

This domain implements proactive defense mechanisms to prevent failures, ensure system resilience, and maintain high availability.

## 📁 Components

### Defense Systems
- **`auto-recovery-system.js`** - Automated system recovery and healing

### Defense Strategies
- **Failure Prevention**: Proactive identification and mitigation of potential failures
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automated system healing and restoration
- **Circuit Breakers**: Protection against cascading failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintaining service during partial failures

## 🎯 Defense Principles

### Proactive Protection
Identify and address potential issues before they cause system failures.

### Automated Recovery
Implement self-healing capabilities to minimize downtime and manual intervention.

### Resilient Architecture
Design systems to withstand and recover from various failure modes.

## 🔧 Recovery Mechanisms

### Automatic Healing
- **Service Restart**: Automatic restart of failed services
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection to external systems
- **Data Repair**: Automatic correction of corrupted data
- **Configuration Reset**: Restore known-good configurations

### Monitoring and Detection
- **Health Checks**: Continuous system health monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual system behavior
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance metrics
- **Alert Management**: Intelligent alerting and escalation

## 📊 Defense Metrics

- **MTTR** (Mean Time To Recovery): Average time to restore service
- **MTBF** (Mean Time Between Failures): System reliability measurement
- **Availability**: System uptime percentage
- **Recovery Success Rate**: Percentage of successful automatic recoveries
