# 🏗️ Domain-Driven Design Architecture (Level 3)

This directory implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Level 3 architecture as specified in the CLAUDE.md protocol, organizing code by business domains for maximum cohesion and minimal coupling.

## 📁 Domain Structure

### Core Domains

#### 🤖 `automation/`
**Pipeline, auto-execution, command triggers**
- Automated deployment workflows
- CI/CD pipeline management
- Command execution automation
- Task scheduling and triggers

#### 📊 `monitoring/`
**System status, Grafana, anomaly detection**
- Real-time system monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check implementations
- Alert and notification systems

#### 🛡️ `security/`
**Credentials, environment variables, access control**
- Secure credential management
- Environment variable handling
- Access control policies
- Security audit systems

#### 🔍 `analysis/`
**Conversations, patterns, AI requirements auditor**
- Data analysis modules
- Pattern recognition
- AI-powered requirement auditing
- Performance analysis tools

#### 🔗 `integration/`
**MCP trinity, Claude connectors**
- External API integrations
- MCP tool implementations
- Third-party service connectors
- Data synchronization modules

### Supporting Domains

#### 🚀 `deployment/`
**ClaudeOS v2, todo management**
- Deployment orchestration
- Environment management
- Todo and task management
- Release coordination

#### 🛠️ `defense/`
**Proactive defense systems**
- Error prevention
- System resilience
- Failure recovery
- Defensive programming utilities

#### 🌐 `api/`
**Real-time feedback APIs**
- API endpoint definitions
- Real-time communication
- Feedback mechanisms
- API gateway functions

#### 🔧 `utils/`
**Common utilities and helpers**
- Shared utility functions
- Helper modules
- Common data structures
- Cross-domain utilities

## 🎯 Design Principles

### High Cohesion
Each domain contains closely related functionality that serves a specific business purpose.

### Low Coupling
Domains are designed to minimize dependencies between each other, using well-defined interfaces.

### Bounded Contexts
Each domain represents a bounded context with its own ubiquitous language and models.

### Domain Expertise
Code is organized around business capabilities rather than technical layers.

## 📚 Usage Guidelines

1. **Domain Boundaries**: Keep domain-specific logic within its respective domain
2. **Cross-Domain Communication**: Use well-defined interfaces and events
3. **Shared Kernels**: Place truly shared utilities in the `utils/` domain
4. **Domain Services**: Implement complex business logic as domain services
5. **Infrastructure**: Keep infrastructure concerns separate from domain logic

This structure enables better maintainability, testability, and scalability while aligning with enterprise software development best practices.
